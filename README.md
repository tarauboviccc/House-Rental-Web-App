# House Rental Web App

My first Angular web application that lists houses for rent and displays detailed information about individual houses. The app showcases common features such as filtering the houses depending on location, as well as submitting a form to apply to live in a selected house.

Note: I have learned to create this project by following the tutorial provided on the Angular official website - https://angular.io/tutorial/first-app.
